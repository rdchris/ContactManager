This is an example I put together on my own time we later added to our code base. 
It's a basic javascript (ExtJs 3.4) GUI that allows for adding, updating and deleting records. 
I was a full stack developer for this task, so I made the database changes (MySQL), wrote the ORM changes (hibernate), wrote the RESTful web-services, coded the GUI, & wrote the automated regression (selenium).
The only piece I wrote during non-work hours is the code seen here, the other pieces I cannot include due to corporate policies.
